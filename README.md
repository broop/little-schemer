Code from the book in two versions.

`ls.rkt` includes Racket library calls for trace debugging and console printing.

`ls.scm` is the 'pure' version which can be loaded into a pure Scheme interpreter, such as Schemish.

Note: This code is basically a through-versioned working of the code in the book. There are page numbers in most places and you will find multiple versions of functions as they are developed in the text; not only the final product.
